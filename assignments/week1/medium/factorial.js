/*
  Write a function `calculateFactorial` that takes a positive integer as a parameter and returns its factorial.
  Factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.
*/

function calculateFactorial(n) {
    // Your code here
}

console.log(calculateFactorial(5));  // Expected output: 120
console.log(calculateFactorial(0));  // Expected output: 1
console.log(calculateFactorial(8));  // Expected output: 40320


// Hint:The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.
// For example:
// The factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
// The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.
